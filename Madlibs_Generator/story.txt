Today was a <adjective> day at the beach. The sun was shining brightly in the <noun>, and the waves crashed rhythmically against the <noun>. I could feel the warm <noun> beneath my feet as I walked along the shore.

I decided to build a <noun> out of sand. With my <noun> and <noun>, I began shaping the sand into turrets and walls. It wasn't long before my <noun> resembled a majestic castle, fit for a king.

After playing in the sand for a while, I decided to go for a swim. The water was refreshingly <adjective>, and I floated on my back, gazing up at the <noun> sky above. It was so peaceful, listening to the sound of seagulls <verb> overhead.

As the day turned to evening, I watched the <noun> set over the horizon, painting the sky in shades of <color>. It was a perfect end to a perfect day at the beach.
